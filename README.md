# Python

Scripts written in Python 3 and greater.

Covering a variety of areas.

Credit where credit is due not all of these started as my own work but are progressively being adapted and modified as I learn.

> Some of these projects started as Python 2.7 versions and have been updated with other features being added as they progress.
